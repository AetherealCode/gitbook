You can access your drafts by clicking the ‚úèÔ∏èicon

A draft is an **editable** version of your content only accessible by your [members](https://docs.gitbook.com/collaboration/team-management#invite-members-to-your-organization), and is automatically created once you start writing \(first letter on the editor, creation of a new page, uploading a picture, etc.\).

Changes made on a **draft are proper to it** which allows you to contribute on the same document with other members simultaneously without creating any conflicts! This is what we call asynchronous editing and conflict resolution.

‚Äã**`Tips:`** `Name each draft to know what you have been working on. This will help you to know what a draft is about and helps you maintain a better overview of changes.`

## ‚Äã‚úÖ Save edits <a id="save-edits"></a>

The first version of draft isn't always ready to be published straight away. Use "**save**" when you want to continue your work later, or if your content is not yet ready to be "[merged]()".
